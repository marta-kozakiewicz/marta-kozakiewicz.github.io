<p class="abstract">
People tend to overestimate their abilities and chances of success, even though
inaccurate beliefs lead to costly mistakes. How can these beliefs persist in the face of
feedback? I propose a novel experiment to test whether people perceive favorable
feedback as more informative. Using experimental data, I provide the first causal
evidence that utility from beliefs affects perception of signal informativeness. To
establish causality, I adopt a matching estimator approach and construct a counterfactual outcome of an agent who observed the same signal, but the signal didn't affect his belief-based utility. I find a strong and significant effect, with a positive
asymmetry: subjects tend to interpret favorable signals as more informative. The
results cast a new light on the origins of overconfidence and illuminate mechanisms
that perpetuate it regardless of received feedback.

<p class="abstract">
 We  test  experimentally  the  theory  of  misguided  learning  formulated  by  Heidhues et al. (2018).  The model predicts the behavior of an agent who has a biased perception of his ability and is learning about an unknown, decision-relevant parameter.  We use a novel experimental design to demonstrate that the learning process of an overconfident agent differs significantly from that of an unbiased agent.  In a dynamic setting, the overconfident agent repeatedly takes suboptimal actions, misinterprets  the  output  and  forms  erroneous  beliefs  about  the  unknown  parameter. We provide the first empirical evidence that giving a biased agent the opportunity to experiment and acquire new information is not only ineffective, but in some cases counterproductive.
