<p class="abstract">
 We  test  experimentally  the  theory  of  misguided  learning  formulated  by  Heidhues et al. (2018).  The model predicts the behavior of an agent who has a biased perception of his ability and is learning about an unknown, decision-relevant parameter.  We use a novel experimental design to demonstrate that the learning process of an overconfident agent differs significantly from that of an unbiased agent.  In a dynamic setting, the overconfident agent repeatedly takes suboptimal actions, misinterprets  the  output  and  forms  erroneous  beliefs  about  the  unknown  parameter. We provide the first empirical evidence that giving a biased agent the opportunity to experiment and acquire new information is not only ineffective, but in some cases counterproductive
