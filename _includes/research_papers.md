<p class="abstract">
This paper studies how people form beliefs in environments with multiple
unknown parameters, some of which are relevant to agents'
self-esteem. In particular, we examine how initial bias in beliefs about an
ego-relevant characteristic affects
learning about the state of the world. Using data from a laboratory experiment,
we demonstrate that the learning process of an overconfident agent is self-defeating:
the agent repeatedly takes suboptimal actions, misinterprets the output, and forms
increasingly mistaken beliefs about the state. Therefore, we corroborate the theory
of misguided learning formulated by Heidhues et al. (2018). We provide the first
empirical evidence that allowing a biased agent to experiment and acquire new
information is not only ineffective but in some cases counterproductive. Furthermore,
we move beyond the theory as we examine how learning about multiple parameters
evolves in ego-relevant and ego-neutral environments.

<p class="abstract">
Do people update their beliefs differently after positive versus negative feedback? The existing literature disagrees on the magnitude and direction of the bias. In this paper, I propose a new experiment guided by a simple model of belief choice. The experimental data reveal a strong asymmetry in updating after "good" versus "bad" news. Moreover, I design a control condition that allows a clear identification of belief manipulation and provides robust evidence on the underlying mechanism. The results point towards the role of affect (or utility from beliefs shifted by the signal) in asymmetric updating. The proposed method can be applied more broadly to study belief-based utility and its role in belief formation.

<p class="abstract">
 In this paper, I experimentally test a model of belief choice with reference-dependent utility. The basic idea is that people can "prepare themselves" for the arrival of new information by adopting overly pessimistic beliefs. By distorting her prior beliefs, an agent can 1) hedge against a painful downward shift in beliefs after a negative signal and 2) enhance a pleasant surprise from a positive signal.  To test the model, I designed a lab experiment in which subjects solve an IQ test and subsequently report beliefs about their relative performance. I introduce an exogenous variation in subjects' expectations over the upcoming signal, which allows me to identify belief manipulation. The results confirm the main predictions of the model, substantiating the claim that utility from beliefs is reference-dependent. Furthermore, I examine a previously unexplored link between gain-loss attitudes and overconfidence, and confirm it in the data.
