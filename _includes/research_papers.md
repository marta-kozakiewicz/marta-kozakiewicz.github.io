<p class="abstract">
People tend to overestimate their abilities and chances of success, even though inaccurate beliefs lead to costly mistakes. How can these beliefs persist in an environment with frequent feedback? I propose a new test of the hypothesis that people interpret favorable feedback to be more informative. Using experimental data, I provide the first causal evidence that the utility from beliefs affects one's perception of signal informativeness. To establish causality, I adopt a matching estimator approach and construct a counterfactual outcome of a subject who observes the same signal, but the signal is not affecting his belief-based utility. I find a strong and significant effect: subjects interpret favorable signals to be more informative due to changes in belief-based utility.  The results cast a new light on the origins of overconfidence and illuminate mechanisms that perpetuate it in the face of feedback.

<p class="abstract">
 We  test  experimentally  the  theory  of  misguided  learning  formulated  by  Heidhues et al. (2018).  The model predicts the behavior of an agent who has a biased perception of his ability and is learning about an unknown, decision-relevant parameter.  We use a novel experimental design to demonstrate that the learning process of an overconfident agent differs significantly from that of an unbiased agent.  In a dynamic setting, the overconfident agent repeatedly takes suboptimal actions, misinterprets  the  output  and  forms  erroneous  beliefs  about  the  unknown  parameter. We provide the first empirical evidence that giving a biased agent the opportunity to experiment and acquire new information is not only ineffective, but in some cases counterproductive.
